## Notes:

- every data modification should re-render(refresh) all users in the table
- How to create users with unique id - [https://github.com/typicode/lowdb#how-to-use-id-based-resources](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb#how-to-use-id-based-resources)
- How to implement sorting, search, pagination on the server - [https://github.com/typicode/lowdb#reading-from-existing-json-file](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb#reading-from-existing-json-file)

    Lowdb is using `lodash` under the hood - [https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.11](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.11) 

    So you can use any method from lodash on your `db.get('users')` collection.
